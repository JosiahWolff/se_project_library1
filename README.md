# Triple Peaks Library

The Triple Peaks Library webpage is the first project in the Software Engineer program at TripleTen. It contains an interactive event calendar, enabling users to stay updated on upcoming library events.
An intuitive navigation, allowing users to seamlessly explore the website while sustaining a visually appealing layout, captivating users' attention and enhancing engagement.


## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Vertical stacking with z-index

## Plans to improve

-I would love to make this site a full-stack application adding the ability for users to create accounts.
-I would also like to add a search section where the user can search for aritcles or books and view previews of them.
-Also add to the calendar section, adding events and displaying the closest event.
